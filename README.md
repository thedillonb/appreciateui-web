Summary
---------------

This repository contains the code necessary for the AppreciateUI front-end web application.
The project is written to leverege the JSON API provided by the AppreciateUI backend and display the UI images in a
responsive web application. The project uses AngularJS and jQuery.


Native Mobile Application
--------------------------

The original project was created for native mobile use only on the iOS platform which can be found in the 
~~iTunes Store~~ (this app is no longer for sale) but I found it to be useful to create
a web specific application as well which spawned this project. I have also posted the mobile source code which can be
found on github: [appreciateui](https://github.com/thedillonb/appreciateui).
