Summary
---------------

This repository contains the code necessary for the [AppreciateUI](http://www.appreciateui.com) front-end web application.
The project is written to leverege the JSON API provided by the AppreciateUI backend and display the UI images in a
responsive web application. The project uses AngularJS and jQuery.


Native Mobile Application
--------------------------

The original project was created for native mobile use only on the iOS platform which can be found in the 
[iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appreciateui/id651317060?ls=1&mt=8) but I found it to be useful to create
a web specific application as well which spawned this project. I have also posted the mobile source code which can be
found on github: [appreciateui](https://github.com/thedillonb/appreciateui).
